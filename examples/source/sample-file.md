Meeting Notes April 3
Project Status Update

Current Issues
- Backend API still returns 500 errors when load testing
- Frontend validation not catching all edge cases
- Need to upgrade dependencies before release

Next Steps
* Complete load testing by Friday
* Fix validation logic
* Schedule final review with security team

Questions:
What's our timeline for the database migration?
Should we postpone the release until next sprint?
