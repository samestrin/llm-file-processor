# Web Content Summarization for LLM Training Data

## Instructions

You are an expert data processor preparing web content for LLM training. For each web page provided:

1. Extract the core information while removing noise (ads, navigation, footers)
2. Create a structured summary with the following components:
   - Title (as a level 1 heading)
   - Source URL
   - Date of publication (if available)
   - Primary author(s) (if available)
   - 2-3 sentence TL;DR summary
   - Key topics (as a comma-separated list of 3-7 keywords/phrases)
   - Main content summary (200-300 words preserving essential information)
   - Important quotes (if any, up to 3 direct quotes with attribution)
   - Structured data (extract factual information in JSON format where appropriate)

3. Format Requirements:
   - Output in valid markdown
   - Include YAML frontmatter with metadata
   - Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections)
   - Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences max)
   - Remove subjective language and maintain neutral tone
   - Standardize terminology across all processed documents

## Output Format

```yaml

processing_date: "{{current_date}}"
word_count_original: 1234 # approximate
